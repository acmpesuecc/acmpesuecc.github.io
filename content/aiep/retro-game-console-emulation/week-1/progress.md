title: Learning the toolchain
lead: Sriprad Potukuchi

summary: The mentees learnt git and make!
---

Seeing as how the project is hosted on GitHub, The mentees have spent the first few days familiarizing themselves with Git and GitHub.
This was done via a combination of discord vc hangouts and independent study.

Once everyone was up and running with Git and could push to / pull from the repository, we moved on to Makefiles! The importance of using a build system such as Make was understood and some basic Makefiles were written for practice.

**Week 1 verdict**: This project has a great bunch of mentees working on it :D Everyone is super eager to learn and the discord vc's were a blast!

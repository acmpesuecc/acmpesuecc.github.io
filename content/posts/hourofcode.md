We, the members of ACM PESUECC Student Chapter conducted the 'Hour of Code' event at The Amaatra Academy on the 13th and 14th of December 2019.
Our major goal was to bring interest in the students towards Computer Science. We introduced game application development in an interactive way to class 6 students and taught them the logic behind it.

The students of 6th std were introduced to the concepts of Scratch and were told the benefits of pair programming Post the briefing session, the students began the hands on session on "Game development using MIT app inventor" where students developed "Space Invader" Game. ACM PESU-ECC Team is thankful to ACM India for giving us the opportunity to conduct the Hour of Code event.

We, the members of ACM PES University EC Campus Student Chapter had our Inauguration ceremony on 
campus on the 11th of September.

Our main objective was to provide a general idea as to what ACM is, what ACM
has to offer and other benefits of joining ACM. We provided information on how
the attendees can join our chapter as well.

# HacktoberFest 2019

We, the members of ACM PESUECC Student Chapter conducted a 12-hour 'Open Source Hack Night' in association with Hacktoberfest. Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. It is an event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean and DEV. Our main objective was to promote open source contributions and provide a platform for the participants to showcase their skills. The participants were also part of a GSoC (mentor and panel discussion partner) panel discussion and a brief on Open Source Projects by Mozilla (community partners) employees. Our food partner for the event was 'I am Vadapav.'
